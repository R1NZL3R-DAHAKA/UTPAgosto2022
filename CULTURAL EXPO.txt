Contrasting with the previous presentation, we are going to talk about the case of the elderly, specifically those over 40 years of age and why it is more difficult for them to leave the house.

I've summed up in 3 main factors: Family, Work and Social.

First the family factor, most 40s people already have a family, wife and/or children and it becomes the main responsibility. And if is the case that they move with the whole the family they must look for the best quality of life, secure neightborhood, schools and universities nearby and other neccesities. It becomes so troublesome and difficult that they prefer to live in a place they already know.

Second we have work factor, over 40s is more difficult to apply a new job, because most companies look for young single people. They do this to economize in salary, life insurance, etc. Language is another problem, sometimes it is a requirement and learning a new language for some people at 40s becomes so difficult that they give up or don't even try. And the title or degree they had received is not valid if it doesn't have international accreditation.

Finally the social factor. They are already well stablished in their homes, they know the playing fiel but in another country everything will be different they must adapt to the new laws, rules, society, culture. Besides they will probably experience some kind discrimination.

Because of their nationality, the local people are not going to rent or sell houses or apartments to them. All because of stereotypes or xenophobia.
