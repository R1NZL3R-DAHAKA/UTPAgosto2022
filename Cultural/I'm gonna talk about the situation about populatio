I'm gonna talk about the situation about populations near Sabancaya and Ubinas and about the suggested emercency plan.
To give you a little context about this situation in 1986 Scabancaya volcano began eruptive process, and it was the beggining of research and monitoring of Peruvian volcanoes.
In 2000 Volcanology proffessionals were trained thanks to the cooperation between the IGP and IRD from France
In 2019 All the geofiphiscal network is completely operational. Thanks to this they can prevent an eruption with a week in advance. However if an erathquake happened, some volcanoes might erupt without anticipation. Earquakes are hard to predict.

talking about evacuation plan or contincey plan. They had been already planned and published by INDECI. In addition, the volcanoes are being monitored in real time by OVS and IGP.

The evacuation plan is divided in 3 parts talking about what to do before, during and after the eruption.

Before is recomendated to relocate the people, who live nearby the volcanoes, to a safe location. And whose don't want to be relocated give them information about emercency backpack the evacuation routes, where will be located the emergency shelters and identify the emergency brigade whose will guide them during and after the eruption.
